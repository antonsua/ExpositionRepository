Made in C++ using SDL framework

## Brief description

**MAD GAME** is a boardGame ***(2 or 4 players)*** in which you will have to be both, the most *pro gamer* and the most *lucky guy*, to end up with more points than anyone else and win the match!

At the beginning of each round the players play a **minigame**. That round's player order is determinied by the ending players' positions on the minigame. Afterwards, following the order, each player picks a *dice* between 1 and 4 (dices cannot be repicked).

**Dices** symbolize the amount of tokens that player will throw on the board. If a *token* falls in a free square ***(8x8 squares)***, the player will become the ***owner*** and recieve points based on the value of the square. But if the *token* falls in other's players square, he will have to pay him a *fee*!

After ***6 rounds*** the match is finished and the richest player is the winner :money_with_wings: .
